Here is a list of my top modules and descriptions

 ### HTML and CSS:
 
 A module focused on the basics of HTML and CSS in web page development. The course teaches how to setup the content (HTML) and the style/looks of a website (CSS).
 
 In this module I learned how I can personalize my work and produce it in a way that has high functionality and also is enjoyable to look at for the viewer. I learned how to input links and create image size to make a website appealing to the viewers. Also the importance of headers and lists to organize web pages. Finally, I learned how id's and classes can be used to create more organized code and make it easier to repeat the same CSS styles.

 ### Intro to JS:
 
 Intro to JS teaches the basics to getting into writing Java Script code. The module teaches important parts of JS that can be combined with HTML and CSS to make great things. This includes shape drawing color, functions and most importantly - Object Oriented Programing. 
 
 What I learned from my experiance with Intro to JS helped me with other projects. Object oriented programming particularly helped my with the coding challenge and will continue to help me in the future.

 ### Advanced JS: Games and Visualization:
 
This module on Advanced Games and Visuizations teaches about interactivity using JS and object oriented programing. The course shows how to use game slides, buttons, mouse clicked and more to create a game that is playable through JS.

What I learned from this was how to code well through functions and objects. Though it was hard at first, I eventually learned how important these were to creating a functioning game. I also improved on using functions to read user input like x/y position of the mouse or mouseClicked. This includes a refactoring of a Khan Academy Game.

 ### Advanced JS: Natural Simulations:
 
 Natural Simulations continues to expand on what was learned previously. This module goes over noise, random generation, vectors and more. These are all very important when making some simulations like the ones from Dan Shiffman's coding challenges. 
 
 I learned a lot about vectors which was important for me because of their usage in my coding challenege. Also the use of noise has helped me impliment true randomness and random number generators in my code.

 ### FreeCodeCamp.org - ES6 JS:

  A course about the transition from ES5 to ES6 and the varius appplications of ES6 into coding. 
Demonstrates how ES6 is used to create more efficiant code writing and more compact code writing.
For the associated project, I made a program to identify pallendromes using techniques from ES6 
JS.

  Personally, I learned how to use aspects of ES6 such as classes and promisies to create more accurate
and less buggy programs. I chose this module on FreeCodeCamp because of it's relation to my coding challege. 
IN particular, the lessons on classes help 'a ton because of their common use in my coding challenge
originally writen by Dan Shiffman.

 ### Coding Challenge Live Presentation:

    In the coding challenge presentations, we were tasked with reacreating a coding session hosted by none other than Dan Shiffman.
  We were to take the code and make our own creative refactoring and present our work in an engaging but also
  informitive way and encourage our audience to continue working on Dan Shiffman's base version of the code. 
  
   For our coding challenge (Saugat and I) we recreated Dan Shiffman's Snake Game Redux. Some of the changes I made were adding more classes using ES6 to make the code more organized as well as adding a new mechanic to the game in the form of poisonous food that would end the game if consumed by the snake. We also created a presentation that successfully engaged our audience with the code and taught them about the various math and computer science consepts used in this coding challenge.
