9. ### FreeCodeCamp.org - ES6 JS:

A course about the transition from ES5 to ES6 and the varius appplications of ES6 into coding. 
Demonstrates how ES6 is used to create more efficiant code writing and more compact code writing.
For the associated project, I made a program to identify pallendromes using techniques from ES6 
JS.


Personally, I learned how to use aspects of ES6 such as classes and promisies to create more accurate
and less buggy programs. I chose this module on FreeCodeCamp because of it's relation to my coding challege. 
IN particular, the lessons on classes help 'a ton because of their common use in my coding challenge
originally writen by Dan Shiffman.
